# Project Title

This Solidity program is a simple "Token_creation_Practice_code" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language to add token and reduce tokens associated with an ethereum address. It is not a live programe to add and reduce tokens of an ethereum address but a practice code to show the logic behiend how mint and burn function work on an ethereum address in solidity programming language
## escription

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has token name ,token abbreg , totallsupply of token related to an ethereum address, Here My Token Name is "BNX" , The token  two function that add , reduce token associated with a hash address. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
