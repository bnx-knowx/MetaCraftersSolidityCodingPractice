# Project Title

This Solidity program is a simple "Token_creation_Practice_code" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language to add token and reduce tokens associated with an ethereum address. It is not a live programe to add and reduce tokens of an ethereum address but a practice code to show the logic behiend how mint and burn function work on an ethereum address in solidity programming language
## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has token name ,token abbreg , totallsupply of token related to an ethereum address, Here My Token Name is "BNX" , The token abbreviation(in short 'Abbre'), a mapping to the ethereum address with it's associated token Ballance.There are two functions that add , reduce token associated with an ethereum address . They are mint and burn. 

mint function adds token to an specefic ethereum address. It has two parameters one is for the etheriam address and other is the volume of the tokens to be added to the ballance of the etheriam address.

burn function deducts tokens form an specefic ethereum address. It has two parameters one is for the etheriam address and other is the volume of the tokens to be deducted from the ballance of the etheriam address.

## Getting Started

* How to run the program

In oder to execute the solidity code in remix follow these steps one by one.

1-goto https://remix.ethereum.org/

2-on your left there is File Explorer section here find a icon of paper its the new file icon click on it

3-now give a name to newly created file and give the extention .sol . for example token_creation_code.sol here (token_creation_code) is the file name and (.sol) is the file extension name

4-onece you enterd file name and extention and press enter. Now you can past the code in the file editor section on the upper right hand side on the website

### Executing program

5-on the left side of the file explorer there are big icons. Hover your mouse cursore over them and they will show name of the icons click on Solidity Compiler icon

6-now see the to the right side of the icons the Solidity Compiler options has appeared. Now click on the compiler version and set it to ("0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7"). as i have written the code in . then click on (compile token_creation_code.sol) to compile the code

7-Now to execute the code, click on the DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS icon from the big icons section on the left end side of the site then Click on deploy.

8-Now your code is deployed . Remember it is not deployed on the real blookchin network rather on localnetwork of remix.




## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues.

if get stuck watch this video where i am copying the code from my repository to remix and execute it
